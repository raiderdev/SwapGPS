# SwapGPS
The domain swapgps.com appears available. Making a web application capable of grabbing a user's current location and sending it over would be incredibly awesome. With browser notifications/push notifications enabled, a user could request their friend's location --- their phone would vibrate. They open the notification and click "Accept", to send their coordinates.
